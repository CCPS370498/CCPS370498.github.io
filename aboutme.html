      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>In the future, I would like to go to FSU to play baseball and have a degree in either culinary or criminal justice. If I don't go to college I would like to stay in Naples and have an inshore charter boat. I have always been interested in the business world and have always had a passion for learning new things. I am a nice guy and I like to be organized. I am constantly trying to get good grades in school and have my required credits/classes out of the way so I can do the classes recommended for college. In 8th grade, I got a couple of Microsoft certifications and I am currently trying to get my HTML and CSS certifications. When I took a personality test my result was an entrepreneur (ESTP). A couple of short-term goals I have are to make the JV baseball team, get my HTML and CSS certification, get a job, and get good grades. If people were to talk about me I would like to be known as a good hard-working person with a great personality. A couple of things I like to do on the side are play baseball, fish, and play video games.</p>
